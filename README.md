# Template-Creator-for-Indesign
A script to make a wrap or cut edge template with cropmarks and dielines.
I had made a script like this using AppleScript years ago while working in printing. A friend ask me if I still had it, and I didn't, so I wrote a new one in JavaScript.
<p>
This is mainly for Folders and Sample boards.  It creats all the outside crop marks and dielines for a piece of artwork.

For Wrap Edge Boards and folders
<ul>
<li>It will create 2 pages. Page 1 is the Cover, and page 2 is the Liner. The 2nd page will be either 0.25 or 0.5 smaller depending on what you picked because it is the liner.</li>
<li>It will draw all the Crop Marks and Dielines for a Board, but currently only edge marks for folders.  Folders you will still have to step and repeat for your panels.</li>
<li>Both Cropmarks and Dielines will have their own layer.</li>
</ul>
For Cut-Edge Boards and folders
<ul>
<li>It will create 2 pages. Page 1 is the Cover, and page 2 is the Liner. The 2nd page will be the same size as the cover because it is cut-edge.</li>
<li>It will draw all the Crop Marks and Dielines for a Board, but currently only edge marks for folders.  Folders you will still have to step and repeat for your panels.</li>
<li>Both Cropmarks and Dielines will have their own layer.</li>
</ul>
